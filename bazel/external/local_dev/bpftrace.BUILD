# In order to get the same build as the production bpftrace build, you should run the following
# commands in the bpftrace local repo:
#
#   mkdir -p build && cd build
#   export BCC_INSTALL=/<BCC repo path>/build/install
#   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install \
#       -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DENABLE_BFD_DISABLE=OFF -DENABLE_LIBDW=OFF -DENABLE_MAN=OFF \
#       -DLIBBCC_BPF_LIBRARIES=$BCC_INSTALL/lib/libbcc_bpf.a \
#       -DLIBBCC_INCLUDE_DIRS=$BCC_INSTALL/include \
#       -DLIBBCC_LIBRARIES=$BCC_INSTALL/lib/libbcc.a \
#       -DLIBBCC_LOADER_LIBRARY_STATIC=$BCC_INSTALL/lib/libbcc-loader-static.a \
#       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

# Every time you make a local change to bcc and/or bpftrace you have to run make install
# in the local repos.
#
# Note#1: you may need to install the ubuntu package `libcereal-dev` to get it to work.
#
# Note#2: The cmake definitions above should be consistent with `cache-entires` of
# bazel/external/bpftrace.BUILD.
